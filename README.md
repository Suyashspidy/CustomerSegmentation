Customer Segmentation for Ecommerce
This project aims to segment customers based on their past behavior in order to predict their future purchases in an ecommerce setting. Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing strategy as it helps businesses understand their customer base better and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to utilize data-driven techniques to divide customers into distinct groups or segments based on similarities in their purchasing behavior. By understanding these segments, businesses can personalize their marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and ultimately increase revenue.

Data
The data used for this project consists of historical customer transactional data, including information such as purchase history, frequency, monetary value, and other relevant attributes. This data serves as the foundation for segmenting customers and building predictive models.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format suitable for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of key variables, identifying patterns, and gaining insights into customer behavior.
Customer Segmentation: Applying clustering techniques such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, or Gaussian mixture models to segment customers based on their similarities.
Predictive Modeling: Building machine learning models to predict future purchases or customer behavior based on the segmented groups.
Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the segmentation and predictive models using appropriate metrics.
Tools and Technologies
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow
